        <h1> Own Problems </h1>
        <li> Find the smallest positive integer n where \( n^2+1 \) is a multiple of 2029. </li><br>
        <li> \( ABC \) is a triangle with sides \( AB = 10 \), \( AC = 14 \), \( BC = 16 \). A point \(P\) is chosen uniformly inside \(ABC\). <br> What is the probability that 
            \(PA \lt PB\) and \(PA \lt PC\)? </li><br>
        <li> 
            \( ABC \) is an acute triangle with orthocenter \( H \). Let \( X \) and \( Y \) be points on line \( BC \) where \( AX \) and \( AY \) are the internal and external angle bisector of \( \angle BAC \). 
            Then, let \( P \) and \( Q \) be the intersection of \( (AXY) \) and \( (BHC) \). Prove that one of \( P \) or \( Q \) lies on the \(A\)-median, 
            and the other lies on the \(A\)-altitude.
        </li><br>
        <li> Let \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), \( d \), \( e \), \( f \) be positive real numbers such that \[ a + b = d + e, \qquad b + c = e + f \]
            Let \( \Delta_1 \) be a triangle with sides \( \sqrt{a^2+ab+b^2} \), \( \sqrt{c^2+cd+d^2} \), and \( \sqrt{e^2+ef+f^2} \). 
            Let \( \Delta_2 \) be a triangle with sides \( \sqrt{b^2+bc+c^2} \), \( \sqrt{d^2+de+e^2} \), and \( \sqrt{f^2 + fa + a^2} \).
            Prove that these two triangles exist and are not degenerate, and find the difference between the areas of \( \Delta_1 \) and \( \Delta_2 \). 
            Assume \( \Delta_1 \) has a larger area.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            \(ABC\) is a right triangle with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\). Let \(D\), \(E\), \(F\) be on sides \(BC\), \(AC\), and \(AB\) where \(BE \perp AC\), 
            and \(\angle CED = \angle AEF = 45^\circ\). If \(FE = 2\) and \(DE = 6\), and the area of \(ABC\) is \(p/q\) for some relatively prime p and q, find p+q.

        <li> (IMO 1996/4) The positive integers \( a \) and \( b \) are such that the numbers \( 15a + 16b \)  and \( 16a - 15b \) are both squares of positive integers. 
            What is the least possible value that can be taken on by the smaller of these two squares?</li><br>
        <li> 
            (IMO 1998/3) For any positive integer \( n \), let \( d(n) \) denote the number of positive divisors of \( n \) (including 1 and n itself). 
            Determine all positive integers \( k  \) such that \( \frac{d(n^2)}{d(n)} = k \) for some \( n \).
        </li><br>
        <li> (IMO 2025/1) A line in the plane is called sunny if it is not parallel to any of the x-axis, the y-axis, or the line \( x+y=0 \). 
            Let \( n\ge3 \) be a given integer. Determine all nonnegative integers \(k\) such that there exist \(n\) distinct lines in the plane satisfying both of the following
            for all positive integers a and b with \( a+b \le n+1 \), the point \( (a,b) \) lies on at least one of the lines; and
            exactly \(k\) of the \(n\) lines are sunny.</li>
