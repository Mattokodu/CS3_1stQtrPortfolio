        <h1> Own Problems </h1>
        <li> Find the smallest positive integer n where \( n^2+1 \) is a multiple of 2029. </li><br>
        <li> \( ABC \) is a triangle with sides \( AB = 10 \), \( AC = 14 \), \( BC = 16 \). A point \(P\) is chosen uniformly inside \(ABC\). <br> What is the probability that 
            \(PA \lt PB\) and \(PA \lt PC\)? </li><br>
        <li> 
            \( ABC \) is an acute triangle with orthocenter \( H \). Let \( X \) and \( Y \) be points on line \( BC \) where \( AX \) and \( AY \) are the internal and external angle bisector of \( \angle BAC \). 
            Then, let \( P \) and \( Q \) be the intersection of \( (AXY) \) and \( (BHC) \). Prove that one of \( P \) or \( Q \) lies on the \(A\)-median, 
            and the other lies on the \(A\)-altitude.
        </li><br>
        <li> Let \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), \( d \), \( e \), \( f \) be positive real numbers such that \[ a + b = d + e, \qquad b + c = e + f \]
            Let \( \Delta_1 \) be a triangle with sides \( \sqrt{a^2+ab+b^2} \), \( \sqrt{c^2+cd+d^2} \), and \( \sqrt{e^2+ef+f^2} \). 
            Let \( \Delta_2 \) be a triangle with sides \( \sqrt{b^2+bc+c^2} \), \( \sqrt{d^2+de+e^2} \), and \( \sqrt{f^2 + fa + a^2} \).
            Prove that these two triangles exist and are not degenerate, and find the difference between the areas of \( \Delta_1 \) and \( \Delta_2 \). 
            Assume \( \Delta_1 \) has a larger area.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            \(ABC\) is a right triangle with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\). Let \(D\), \(E\), \(F\) be on sides \(BC\), \(AC\), and \(AB\) where \(BE \perp AC\), 
            and \(\angle CED = \angle AEF = 45^\circ\). If \(FE = 2\) and \(DE = 6\), and the area of \(ABC\) is \(p/q\) for some relatively prime p and q, find p+q.

        <li> 
            SO MANY CONCURRENCIES!!!!!!! (Continuation from Iran 2002) <br>
            Let \( ABC \) be a triangle with incircle \( \omega \) touches side \( BC \) at \( A' \). Define \( B' \) and \( C' \) cyclically. 
            Then, the line \( AA' \) intersects \( \omega \) again at \( P \).
            Let lines \( CP \) and \( BP \) intersect \( \omega \) again at \( N \) and \( M \), respectively and 
            the lines intersect \( AB \) and \( AC \) at \( Y \) and \( X \), respectively.
            Prove that these following lines are concurrent:
            \[ AA', BB', CC' \qquad AA', BN, CM \qquad AA', BM, CN \qquad XY, B'C', MN, BC \]

        <li> (IMO 1996/4) The positive integers \( a \) and \( b \) are such that the numbers \( 15a + 16b \)  and \( 16a - 15b \) are both squares of positive integers. 
            What is the least possible value that can be taken on by the smaller of these two squares?</li><br>
        <li> 
            (IMO 1998/3) For any positive integer \( n \), let \( d(n) \) denote the number of positive divisors of \( n \) (including 1 and n itself). 
            Determine all positive integers \( k  \) such that \( \frac{d(n^2)}{d(n)} = k \) for some \( n \).
        </li><br>
        <li> (IMO 2025/1) A line in the plane is called sunny if it is not parallel to any of the x-axis, the y-axis, or the line \( x+y=0 \). 
            Let \( n\ge3 \) be a given integer. Determine all nonnegative integers \(k\) such that there exist \(n\) distinct lines in the plane satisfying both of the following
            for all positive integers a and b with \( a+b \le n+1 \), the point \( (a,b) \) lies on at least one of the lines; and
            exactly \(k\) of the \(n\) lines are sunny.</li>
