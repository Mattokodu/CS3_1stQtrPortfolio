## Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.
# by Mateo Espocia from 9 - Rubidium

1. Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting

- more teaching positions
- health coverage expansion
- every part of the philippines apparently has available medical service

2. Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason (explaining is optional)

- when marcos mentioned the asian men's curling team during the winter games
(weird to mention *that* in the middle of everything when there are clearly a lot of things going on in our nation)
- **"Napatunayan natin na kaya na natin ang bente pesos sa bawat kilo ng bigas, nang hindi malulugi ang mga magsasaka!"**

3. Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)

A lot of people were hopeful about what Marcos promised during the 2025 SONA. For example, he mentioned about improvements in education and health. While I was listening to the SONA in my TV, I was a bit skeptical on some of the points he mentioned like *is it really the case that we have the second largest percentage of college graduates in ASEAN? *

While some of the information that Marcos gave is correct, some (like the 20-peso bigas one) are misleading. His speech also does not focus much on the more important issues of our country like gambling (POGOs), poverty, growing population, climate change, etc. What I hope for is that we Filipinos make a positive impact and cooperate to make our country a better place.

4. What 1 word / phrase / or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?

My phrase is as follows.
# Way way way easier said than done
