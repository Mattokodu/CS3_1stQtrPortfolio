# **For School:**
### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with 2-5 sentences.

1. **Functions** - These are blocks of code that are grouped together. Functions can be convenient when we want to run that same block of code multiple times. In most programming languages, functions can be used without needing to code them. For example, exponentiation with the following:
```py
import math
print(math.pow(2, 1.5))
```
2. **Conditionals (If Else, Switch)** - If this true, do this action. Otherwise, do this other action. This is the essence of conditionals. There are also switch statements which is basically an if-else statement where the computer checks if some variable is *equal to* something.
3. **Boolean Operators** - Booleans are variables that can either hold the value of true or false. Boolean operators are just operators that take in booleans and result in a boolean. Common ones include *and*, *or*, *not*, *xor*, etc. and they are used a lot as logic gates. 
4. **Arithmetic Operators** - These are operators that take in one or more numbers, and result in a number. Unlike the usual four, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, we get introduced to the modulo operator, which results in the remainder when the first number is divided with the second number.
5. **JavaScript Craziness with Operators** - Since JavaScript is a lenient programming language, we can do some crazy stuff. For example, 5 == '5' is true, but 5 === '5' is false. There are a lot more crazy things such as:
```javascript
console.log(('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase())
// results in banana
console.log('bat' && 'cog')
// results in 'cog'
console.log(!'bat' || !'dog')
// results in false
```
(I actually do not know this **very well**, but I do not think this needs further discussion.)

### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

1. **Storing Data** - I don't think this has been discussed and I know it will likely be. I just heard about the fact that we will have nodeJS in fourth quarter.
2. **CSS Design** - This is not really intuitive and often I use AI for help in formatting whenever I make websites. (or I become too lazy, I think this is the reason most of the time for me, I'm just kinda lazy in designing)
3. **Text Formatting** - This is totally not to try to fill up the 5 topics. Again, this relates to CSS Design. 
4. **JS Input/Output System** - If this can be implemented into making websites, I think this should be discussed more deeply. I genuinely forgot that lesson because it was held online.
5. **Using Github** - So, we need to collab with our pairmate for the rest of the school year. I know it is possible to share directories with other people (I got invited to someone's directory), but I am not sure how.

### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

For the case of making websites, I think that CSS can just be mastered with enough practice. I will also try to use AI effectively.

### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

**Effective (!!)**:

1. At least one person per table reciting with the really good microphone
2. Sending a website as a guide for coding something (e.g. word game)

**Ineffective (??)**:

1. Trying to get the class's attention normally?
2. I can't think of one more
