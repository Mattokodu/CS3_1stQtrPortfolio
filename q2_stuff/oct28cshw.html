    Hello! My name is Mateo Inigo Espocia from section 9-Rubidium as of making this website. Most people know me for my achivements in math.
    First of all, I do like exploring different math concepts from time to time. In fact,
    I have a private collection of my own math problems. Some of my other hobbies include playing 
    the keyboard, listening and making to music, and playing <b>Stardew Valley.</b> 
    <br><br>
    Fun fact: The probability that two natural numbers are coprime (have no common factors except 1) is <strong>6 divided by pi squared</strong>.
